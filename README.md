DNS Update Timeout Resource Record

This specification defines a new DNS TIMEOUT resource record (RR) that associates a lifetime with one or more zone resource records with the same owner name and class. It is intended to be used to transfer resource record lifetime state between a zone's primary and secondary servers and to store lifetime state during server software restarts.

This draft is an individual submission for the DNSOP Working Group of the IETF.
